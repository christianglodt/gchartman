This file describes known issues with gChartman. Unfortunately not all bugs are
known.

- Do not use umlauts (ü,ö,ä,etc) in any text you enter into the program,
  it will crash because of an xml entity issue.

- Anything that is a child of a moving average is very probably wrong. 

- The channel module is broken, not ported to the new module interface,
  and needs a rewrite. That's why it's disabled.

- The comment module currently only saves 1 line of comment (xml entity issue).

- alevt-cap needs the `-oldbttv' option to work with the bttv driver from the
  Linux 2.2.18 kernel. With the bttv-0.7.25 driver from  http://www.strusel007.de
  this was not necessary.

- Lots of other stuff...
