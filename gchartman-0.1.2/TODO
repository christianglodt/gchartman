Note: This does not reflect importance or any order of implementation. Typically less
important changes are more boring to implement and might be delayed until everything
else works :)

& means work in progress

Major Changes/Efforts:
- Design a clean database layout.
- Use gnome-db for compatibility with different databases (wrap data access into
  a well defined interface).
- Add data editor (?) (just for 1 kind of database layout?).
- Support different data sources (streams, quotes from the net, imports).
- Support downloading quotes into local database (libstocks).
- Support gnome-print to print out charts.
& Clean up the module interface.

Medium Changes/Efforts:
+ Replace list of chart items with more flexible tree. Implement functions needed
  to support the tree.
- Add drag&drop support to quickly modify the above-mentioned tree.
- Create a skeleton chart item module which should be really easy to understand & modify.
- Add lots of indicators (delayed until interface stabilization & skeleton creation).
- Implement read-only mode (guaranteed not to modify the database).
+ Move chart configurations to xml files.
- Move videotext configuration to xml file(s).
- Move category configuration to xml file(s).
- Move trading time configuration to xml file(s).
- Move any other appropriate configuration data to xml file(s).
- Use gmodule instead of dlopen() for better portability.

Minor Changes/Efforts:
- UI polishing: Add error messages where needed, maybe druids.
- Get someone to draw some nice icons and toolbar buttons.
- Give exact error messages (possibly with advice) for anything database or
  alevt-cap related.
- Add module function to adjust saved module data after splits.
- Write a preferences dialog, and use gnome functions for preference storage and
  retrieval (videotext timeout, etc...).
- Add a preference option to use the `-oldbttv' option with alevt-cap.
- Provide sensible default (global) chart configurations.
- Selectable default global configuration.
- History display module.
- add Login window combobox history
- Make some of the widgets in the videotext window insensitive during vt capturing.
- Add a popup menu to ChartInstance that modules can extend and display when
  right-clicked (display menu on chart_structure_tree too?)
