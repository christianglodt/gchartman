gChartman is a Gnome program for technical stock analysis. To install
it from source, take the usual approach:

> ./configure
> make
> <become root>
> make install

You need a MySQL database.

- Install the server (most distributions have an RPM for this).
- Install the client libraries (some distributions have a seperate
  RPM for these).
- Install the development packages.

Example: For a  SuSE 6.3 distribution these packages would be needed:
	- mysql
	- mysqlclnt
	- mysqldev

If you have problems, please read the README and documentation included
with mysql, and especially distribution-specific READMEs (for SuSE:
/usr/doc/packages/mysql/README.SuSE).

Since version 0.1.2, gChartman needs libxml2-2.2.7 to save chart configurations.
This means that old configurations are no longer accessible and have to be
recreated.

To capture quotes from videotext, you need a working tv-tuner card supported
by bttv. You also need the alevt-cap program from the alevt package.
Note that gChartman does not select tv channels for you. You can capture quotes
while you are watching tv (tested with xawtv), and indeed you should use a tv
viewer program to select the channel you want to capture quotes from, and
leave it running. Test your videotext interface by trying to use alevt while
you watch tv. If this works, you will also be able to capture quotes with
gChartman. You need to find out if you need the `-oldbttv' option with
alevt-cap. This option is used by default in gChartman. It is necessary for
the bttv driver included in the kernel. It is not necessary when you use the
bttv driver from http://www.strusel007.de/. If videotext capturing times out
even though you have good reception, edit src/getvtquotes.c and define/undef the
OLDBTTV define.

Note: Usually you can not capture videotext data with a digital satellite receiver
connected to your tv-tuner cards composite video input. Analog receivers are ok.
