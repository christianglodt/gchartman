The scripts in this directory have been written during the
development of the main program. They all use awk, some use sed,
and all generate sql scripts. They are not very polished. Execute
them without parameters to see what parameters they expect.
Here's a description of what they do:

csv2sql:
	This script is not useful anymore. It transforms csv files
	downloaded from www.neuer-markt.de to sql-scripts. Unfortunately,
	neuer-markt.de doesn't provide csv files anymore.

getquote:
	This is the same as `csv2sql', but it downloads the csv file
	from neuer-markt.de by itself (using wget). Like `csv2sql', it
	doesn't work anymore.

speku2sql:
	This converts csv files exported by `Spekulator' (which is a windows
	freeware program, see http://rcswww.urz.tu-dresden.de/~roos/S_home.htm).
	It creates a complete database.

swcsv2sql:
	This converts csv files that can be downloaded from www.stockwatch.de.

swgetnemax:
	This downloads all the csv files for all the stocks that are listed on
	the stockwatch.de site in the Nemax All Share index. It takes a lot of
	time if you are on a slow net connection. It creates a complete database.

swgetstock:
	This downloads a csv file for one stock from the stockwatch.de site and
	creates script for it. It is good to get data for a stock you are interested
	in.

txt2speku:
	This converts .txt files (found on http://www-public.tu-bs.de:8080/~y0003876/index.html)
	to csv files that can be imported into the `Spekulator' windows program.

txt2sql:
	This converts .txt files (found on http://www-public.tu-bs.de:8080/~y0003876/index.html)
	to sql scripts.

vtsettings.sql:
	This sql script contains my videotext configuration for the german news channel n-tv.
