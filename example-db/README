To install this example database for the gChartman program,
take the following steps:

1) Install MySQL. Make sure you have a MySQL-account with
   the needed privileges (create, drop, insert, select, delete).
   Test it by executing
   
   mysql -u <username> -p
   
   Enter your password, and you will be given a "mysql> " prompt.
   If this works, you can exit by hitting Ctrl-D.

2) Second you need to create a database. Start the MySQL monitor
   from a shell:
   
   mysql -u <username> -p
   
   At the "mysql> " prompt type:

   create database <dbname>;
   
   Use whatever name you wish as <dbname>, but make sure you remember it.

3) To create the database, execute the following:

   mysql -u <username> -p <dbname> < example-db.sql
   
   You will be asked for your password, and the sql-script will be executed.

Now the database is set up. Once you have started gChartman, hit the "Connect"
button, and enter your username, password and the dbname you used earlier in
the corresponding entries.
